# About Me
-👋 I'm Dev Samrajya, a Front End Developer from Pnq. I love to learn and discover all things JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can catch my code tidbits on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fabulous_samrajya/) and [X](https://x.com/samrajya_dev).

So you're here to learn more about me. Excellent! I love talking about myself 😝. How did I get into tech? I love learning new things. Naturally, tech was the perfect place to be. It’s always changing and always moving forward. First, there was jQuery, then Angular, then React, and now we have Vue.Js. Holy moly! Some people might find this overwhelming but I love it. You’ll never run out of things to learn. #StudentMindset

Beside being a developer, I’m also a Podcaster. I founded and host a podcast called the Events Podcast. This has been a super fun experience for me. I had no idea what I was doing, but I dived right in. I learned by actually doing it. What I learned from this experience is “don’t worry about failing, focus on trying”.

Currently, I'm working as a Frontend Engineer at GitLab. You can follow my journey of becoming a Senior developer in my #SamDocs series on
